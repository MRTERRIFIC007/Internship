# Week 5 - Wednesday: Translation Systems with Attention

## Overview

Today we build complete translation systems using attention mechanisms and explore bidirectional encoders.

## Topics Covered

- Dataset preparation for English-French translation
- Training translation models with attention
- Evaluation and testing strategies
- Bidirectional encoder implementation

## Notebooks

1. translation_dataset_preparation.ipynb
2. attention_translation_training.ipynb
3. translation_evaluation_testing.ipynb
4. bidirectional_encoder_debugging.ipynb

## Key Concepts

- Translation dataset handling
- Attention-based seq2seq training
- BLEU score evaluation
- Bidirectional encoding
- Out-of-vocabulary handling
