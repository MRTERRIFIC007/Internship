# Week 5: Sequence-to-Sequence Models, Attention Mechanisms, and Transformers

## Week Overview

This week marks a major milestone in our machine learning journey as we explore sequence-to-sequence models and attention mechanisms - the foundation of modern NLP. We progress from basic encoder-decoder architectures to state-of-the-art Transformer models.

## Learning Journey

- **Monday**: Introduction to sequence-to-sequence problems and encoder-decoder architectures
- **Tuesday**: Attention mechanisms and solving the information bottleneck
- **Wednesday**: Building complete translation systems with attention
- **Thursday**: Cross-attention and Transformer components
- **Friday**: T5 and multi-task learning

## Key Technologies Covered

- **Encoder-Decoder Models**: LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence architectures
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Basic attention, scaled dot-product attention, cross-attention
- **Translation Systems**: English-French translation with BLEU evaluation
- **Transformer Components**: Multi-head attention, positional encoding
- **T5 Model**: Text-to-text transfer transformer for multi-task learning

## Technical Skills Developed

- **PyTorch Implementation**: Custom attention layers and transformer components
- **Sequence Processing**: Variable-length sequence handling and padding
- **Attention Visualization**: Heatmap generation and interpretation
- **Model Evaluation**: BLEU scores, perplexity, and qualitative analysis
- **Multi-Task Learning**: Dataset mixing and task balancing

This week represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of neural sequence processing and provides the foundation for modern NLP systems.
