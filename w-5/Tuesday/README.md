# Week 5 - Tuesday: Attention Mechanisms

## Overview

Today we learn about attention mechanisms - the solution to the encoder-decoder bottleneck problem.

## Topics Covered

- Problems with basic encoder-decoder models
- Attention mechanism intuition and implementation
- Scaled dot-product attention
- Attention visualization

## Key Concepts

- Information bottleneck problem
- Attention as a "spotlight" mechanism
- Query, Key, Value framework
