# Thursday - Advanced Manifold Learning & Computer Vision

## Activities Completed

- Explored UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) as an alternative to t-SNE
- Implemented transfer learning techniques with pre-trained models
- Applied comprehensive data augmentation strategies for computer vision
- Analyzed model evaluation metrics specifically for image classification tasks
- Compared UMAP vs t-SNE performance across different datasets
- Built transfer learning pipelines from scratch

## Key Learnings

- **UMAP Architecture**: Topological data analysis foundations, fuzzy simplicial sets, and optimization
- **Transfer Learning**: Feature extraction vs fine-tuning strategies, layer freezing, and domain adaptation
- **Data Augmentation**: Geometric transformations, color space manipulations, and advanced techniques
- **Image Classification Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves
- **Model Performance**: Validation strategies, cross-validation, and statistical significance testing
- **Computational Efficiency**: UMAP's superior scalability compared to t-SNE
