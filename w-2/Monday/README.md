# Monday - Feature Selection & Clustering Techniques

## Activities Completed

- Explored different feature selection methods (Filter, Wrapper, Embedded)
- Implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- Learned text processing fundamentals (tokenization, cleaning, stop words)
- Applied hierarchical clustering algorithms and visualization
- Implemented DBSCAN for density-based clustering and anomaly detection

## Key Learnings

- **Feature Selection**: Understanding when to use filter methods (statistical tests), wrapper methods (recursive feature elimination), and embedded methods (LASSO, Random Forest importance)
- **PCA**: Learned how principal components capture variance and reduce dimensionality while preserving information
- **Text Processing**: Mastered tokenization, text cleaning, stop word removal, and basic text preprocessing pipelines
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Implemented agglomerative clustering with different linkage criteria and created dendrograms
- **DBSCAN**: Understanding density-based clustering, core points vs border vs noise points, and applications in anomaly detection

## Tomorrow's Focus

Tomorrow we'll dive into neural networks, starting with perceptron architecture and moving to forward/backward propagation, plus an introduction to self-supervised learning and survival analysis.
