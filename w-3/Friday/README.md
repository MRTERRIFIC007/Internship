## Personal Learning Notes

Friday represents the culmination of our computer vision journey this week. The cartooning project showcases the artistic potential of computer vision - transforming realistic photos into stylized artwork through algorithmic creativity. It's fascinating how combining edge detection, color quantization, and bilateral filtering can mimic the human artistic process.

The object counting system addresses a fundamental challenge in computer vision that has countless practical applications. From quality control in manufacturing to wildlife population monitoring, accurate object detection and counting is essential across industries.

Working through the bilateral filter challenges taught me the importance of parameter tuning in computer vision. Small changes in filter parameters can dramatically affect the final output, highlighting the need for systematic experimentation and validation.

The integration of multiple OpenCV techniques in these projects demonstrates how modern computer vision applications rarely rely on single algorithms. Instead, they combine multiple techniques in carefully orchestrated pipelines to achieve robust, real-world performance.

These projects bridge the gap between academic learning and practical application, showing how computer vision techniques can be combined to create systems that are both technically sophisticated and visually appealing.

The progression from basic image processing (Monday) to advanced applications (Friday) illustrates the rapid learning curve possible in computer vision when building upon solid fundamentals.
