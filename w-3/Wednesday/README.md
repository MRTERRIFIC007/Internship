## Personal Learning Notes

Today represents a significant leap in complexity. We're moving from foundational concepts to advanced, production-ready techniques. Histogram equalization is everywhere in photo editing software, digital watermarking protects intellectual property worth billions, and modern CNN architectures power everything from medical diagnosis to autonomous vehicles.

The mathematical elegance of these techniques is striking - how simple probability theory enables dramatic image enhancement, how subtle frequency domain modifications can embed invisible information, and how deep learning automatically discovers optimal features for classification.

This day bridges the gap between academic understanding and real-world application.
