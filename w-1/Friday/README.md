# Friday - Project Implementation & Model Optimization

## Activities Completed

- Implemented hands-on project work (preprocessing pipeline, baseline models, documentation)
- Compared model performance and selected best approaches
- Applied advanced model optimization techniques
- Prepared models for production deployment

## Key Learnings

- Created complete preprocessing pipelines for classification tasks
- Evaluated and compared multiple models systematically
- Implemented advanced model optimization (feature engineering, handling imbalanced data)
- Built model deployment pipelines with proper serialization and API integration
- Applied model interpretability techniques
