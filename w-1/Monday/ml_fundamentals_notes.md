# AI/ML Fundamentals Notes

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

- Learning from labeled data
- Predicts output based on input
- Examples:
  - Classification (spam detection, image recognition)
  - Regression (price prediction, temperature forecasting)
- Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning

- Learning from unlabeled data
- Finds patterns and structures in data
- Examples:
  - Clustering (customer segmentation, anomaly detection)
  - Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- Common algorithms: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, PCA, Autoencoders

### Reinforcement Learning

- Learning through interaction with environment
- Agent learns to maximize reward
- Examples:
  - Game playing (AlphaGo, Chess)
  - Robotics
  - Autonomous vehicles
- Common algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks, Policy Gradient Methods

## AI vs ML vs Deep Learning

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

- Broader concept of machines mimicking human intelligence
