# Thursday - Classification, Model Evaluation & Project Setup

## Activities Completed

- Learned classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVMs)
- Applied model evaluation metrics and validation techniques
- Implemented hyperparameter tuning strategies
- Set up the project for hands-on implementation

## Key Learnings

- Implemented various classification algorithms and compared their strengths/weaknesses
- Applied evaluation metrics for classification (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, etc.)
- Created model selection workflows with cross-validation
- Tuned hyperparameters with grid and random search
- Selected dataset and defined problem for the hands-on project
